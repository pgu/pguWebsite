			Experimental project to build an architecture that enables a portal of GWT application<strong><em>s</em></strong>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				FW is a base module for others.</li>
			<li>
				NEWS and GAMES are modules that extend FW. They are independent GWT applications.</li>
			<li>
				PORTAL is the module that dynamically aggregates the NEWS and GAMES modules in the page.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			This would allow a big project made up of serveral small GWT applications and served as &#39;one&#39; SAAS application.</p>
