			Experimental project to create a portal of GWT application<strong><em>s</em></strong>:</p>
		<p>
			&#39;fw&#39; is a base module for others.</p>
		<p>
			&#39;news&#39; and &#39;games&#39; are modules that extend &#39;fw&#39;. They are independent GWT applications.</p>
		<p>
			&#39;portal&#39; is the module that dynamically aggregates the &#39;news&#39; and &#39;games&#39; modules in the page.</p>
		<p>
			This would allow a big project made up of serveral small GWT applications and served as &#39;one&#39; saas application.</p>
